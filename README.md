# Theme Cycler

A VSCode extension that cycles through available themes.

## Features

This extension allows you to cycle through all the available themes in your VSCode editor. It does this by registering a command `extension.cycleThemes` which when invoked, changes the current theme to the next one in the list of available themes.

## Usage

To use this extension, you need to invoke the command `extension.cycleThemes`. You can do this by opening the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `extension.cycleThemes`.

## Installation

To install this extension, you can clone the repository and build it locally using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/theme-cycler.git
cd theme-cycler
npm install
npm run compile
```

Then, you can load the extension in VSCode using the `Load Unpacked Extension...` option.
